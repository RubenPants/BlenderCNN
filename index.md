## Project description

The goal of the project is to generate images based on vectoral data. In every image, a floating glowing ball is shown in a dark room. There are two aspects that vary in every image, this being the color and the position of the floating ball.

Every scene is represented by a vector of five floating numbers: 

- Three values representing the RGB-color the glowing ball emits
- Two values representing the position (x and y axis) of the ball

Based on this vector (also called the image's feature), a Deep Learning model tries to re-generate an image of the original scene.

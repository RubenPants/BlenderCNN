# BlenderCNN

See full project description and code explanation on: https://rubenpants.github.io/BlenderCNN/

This repository is an example to show both the potential as the usage of [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to generate data for Deep Learning projects. More specifically, Blender is used to generate 10.000 similar images of a *flying glowing dot*, and stores the image together with a vector presentation of both its location and color. This data is later on used by a Deep Learning model to re-generate the image based on its vector representation alone.
